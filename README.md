## 💻 Why I Decided to Code It Myself
I wanted to challenge myself to apply what I’ve learned in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building a website from scratch. I chose Astro as the framework to learn something new and explore modern web development practices. Its focus on speed and performance made it perfect for a fast, lightweight portfolio site. 

Instead of using a template, I decided to design, code, and structure everything on my own to strengthen my frontend development skills while also learning new technologies.


## 📁 Project Structure
Inside of the Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```
